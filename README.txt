Hello Peter and whomever it may concern,

This project can be launched from opening the index.html file.

I believe the program follows all rules outlined in the Challenge and has the designated functionality requirements. 

Due to currently having a full-time job as a Software Engineer I had limited time. I spent that time mostly building out the application and the functionality, leaving limited time to covering the bugs and fixing them. However, I would be more than happy explaining all of my known issues and how I would solve them.

I would also love to discuss how I would intend to make this application scalable and being able to quickly connect to a database. 

Thank you again for this opportunity,

Matthew Gabriele
